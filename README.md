# About the Project
The project is developed and maintained by:
- Giacomo Romagnoli - giacomo.romagnoli4@studio.unibo.it
- Marco Fontana - marco.fontana17@studio.unibo.it

## Abstract
The current market includes several social networks, 
each differentiated primarily by the type of post that users can publish. 
This project aims to create the backbone of a generic social network,
from which it would be possible to specialize into a fully-fledged application by identifying a particular type of post 
or adding distinctive features.
